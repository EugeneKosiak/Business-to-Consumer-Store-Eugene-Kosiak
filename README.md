# Assignment 2 - B2C Store Application

The goal of this assignment is to design and develop a fully functional **Business-to-Consumer (B2C) Store application** that allows users to browse products, manage a shopping cart, and complete purchases, while administrators manage products and view purchase records.

The application builds on an existing monorepo structure from WSU Blog Post (Assignments 2.1, 2.2, 2.3) and extends it with full e-commerce functionality.

## Success Criteria

- ✅ All of the tests must be passing
- ✅ All existing functionality must remain working
- ✅ You must be able to explain any code in the codebase
- ✅ Database is fully integrated with Prisma and seeded correctly
- ✅ Admin and user flows work end-to-end (auth, cart, purchase, CRUD)

## Prerequisites

First, make sure that "pnpm" and "turbo" is installed in your computer. If not, please follow installation instructions for pnpm. If turbo is not installed, please install it using pnpm with the following command:

Then, run the following command to install turborepo.

```
pnpm add -g turbo
```

## Installing the project

Once the pnpm is installed, in the root of the project install the packages

```
pnpm i or pnpm install
```

To run end to end tests you need to install headless browsers. Please run the following command in the `tests/playwright` directory

```
pnpx playwright install
```

## Environment

In all packages `apps/admin` and `packages/db` find `.env.example` files and copy them to `.env`. Set your environment variables accordingly!

## Running the project

To run the project, run the following command in the root directory of your project:

```
turbo dev
```

This will run:

- Client application at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)
- Admin application at [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002)

## Running tests

To run the tests please run the following in the tests/playwright folder:
- pnpm playwright test --grep @a1
- pnpm playwright test --grep @a2
- pnpm playwright test --grep @a3

For Playwright interface run:
- pnpm playwright test --grep @a1 --ui
- pnpm playwright test --grep @a2 --ui
- pnpm playwright test --grep @a3 --ui

## Project Structure

This project is a monorepo with shared packages and applications.

### Applications

- apps/web → Customer-facing B2C store  
- apps/admin → Admin dashboard  

### Packages

- packages/db → Prisma client, schema, seed data  
- packages/ui → Shared UI components  
- packages/utils → Shared utilities  
- packages/eslint-config → ESLint configuration  
- packages/tailwind-config → Tailwind configuration  
- packages/typescript-config → TypeScript configuration  

### Tests

## Database Schema

Uses Prisma with PostgreSQL.

Core models:

- User → admin/customer authentication  
- Product → catalog items  
- Purchase → order records  
- PurchaseItem → line items  

---

## Application Notes

- Authentication uses JWT stored in httpOnly cookies  
- Products are seeded from `db/src/seed.ts`  
- Cart is session-based with backend validation  
- Purchases are persisted and linked to users  
- Admin features include full product CRUD + filtering  

---

## Final Notes

- All functionality is validated using Playwright E2E tests  
- The system is designed as a full-stack e-commerce application  
- Both admin and client systems share the same database layer
